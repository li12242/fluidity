\chapter{Configuring \fluidity}\label{chap:configuration}

\section{Overview}
\fluidity\ is configured by creating a \fluidity\ options (or flml) file using
Diamond.  The left-hand pane of Diamond allows users to browse the
\emph{options tree}, while the right-hand pane provides brief documentation
about the option and is where users enter input data and record their own
comments.  For more information about Diamond see ???

This chapter aims to provide a detailed description of all the options in
the tree.  From section~\ref{Sect:OptionsTree} onwards, \fluidity\ options are
described in the order in which they appear in Diamond.  Prior to this are
some important general notes about the different types of options and, in
particular, how to work with fields in \fluidity.

\section{Options syntax}
\index{options!syntax}
\fluidity\ options files, or flml files, are XML files whose grammar is defined by the
fluidity options schema \verb+fluidity_options.rng+. XML files have a
tree-like structure of elements containing other elements. This structure is
reflected in the left hand pane of Diamond, the graphical XML editor which
is used to write flml files.

In text, and in code using the Spud library on which the \fluidity\ options
system is based, a location in the options tree can be written as a path,
much like the path of a file on disk. So, for example, the option
controlling the physical dimension of the problem domain is written as
\option{/geometry/dimension}. This should be read as the \option{dimension}
option which is found under \option{geometry} which is in turn at the top
level of the options tree. In Diamond, and in the flml file, the absolute
top level element is always \option{fluidity\_options} but this element is
always discarded from paths. Figure \ref{fig:geometry_dimension}\ shows a
Diamond screenshot open at the \option{/geometry/dimension} option.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \fig[width=.7\textwidth]{geometry_dimension}
  \caption{A Diamond screenshot showing the \option{/geometry/dimension}
    option. Note that the option path is displayed at the bottom of the
    diamond window}
  \label{fig:geometry_dimension}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Allowed Characters}
Only certain characters are recognised by the options dictionary, which contains the flml input once it is read into fluidity. Therefore only the following letters are allowed in any input field:

\begin{verbatim}
 /_:[]1234567890qwertyuioplkjhgfdsazxcvbnmMNBVCXZASDFGHJKLPOIUYTREWQ
\end{verbatim}

Comment boxes may contain any characters. 

\subsection{Named options}
\index{options!names}
Some options in the tree, such as fields and meshes, have name
attributes. The name attribute is represented with a double colon so that,
for example, the coordinate mesh has options path\onlypdf\linebreak
\option{/geometry/mesh::CoordinateMesh}. Note that this differs from the
convention in Diamond in which name attributes are given in brackets. Figure
\ref{fig:mesh_name}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \fig[width=.7\textwidth]{mesh_name}
  \caption{A Diamond screenshot showing the \option{/geometry/mesh::Coordinate}
    option. Note that the name is shown in brackets in the main Diamond
    window but after double colons in the path in the bottom bar.}
  \label{fig:mesh_name}
\end{figure}

Names of objects (fields, material phases, meshes, etc.) should be camel cased (MyOwnField) and not contain spaces or underscores. Furthermore, the characters \verb+/:[]+ are prohibited as these have special meanings in the options dictionary inside \fluidity. 

\section{Working with Fields}
\index{field}
\subsection{Types of field}

A field associates a value with every node in the domain. Examples of fields
in a fluids simulation include the velocity and pressure. Fields in \fluidity
are distinguished by the rank of the data on the field and the way in which
that field is calculated. 

\begin{description}
\item[Scalar fields] have a scalar value at each node. Common examples
  include temperature, pressure and density.
\item[Vector fields] have a vector value, in other words a list of numbers,
  at each node. The rank of a vector field is 1 and the length of the
  vector is given by the dimension of the problem.
\item[Tensor fields] have a value given by a square matrix at each
  node. The side length of the matrix is the problem dimension and the rank
  is naturally 2. The diffusivity of a tracer is a typical example of a
  tensor-valued field.
\end{description}

Fields can also be characterised by the manner in which their value is
calculated. \fluidity\ recognises three such categories:

\begin{description}
\item[Prognostic fields] are the result of solving a partial differential
  equation. In a typical fluids simulation, the velocity and pressure are
  prognostic and are calculated by solving some variant of the Navier-Stokes
  equations. Similarly, tracers such as temperature and salinity are usually
  the result of solving and advection-diffusion equation. Prognostic fields
  typically have specified initial and boundary conditions and it will be
  necessary to specify spatial and temporal discretisation options. If an
  implicit timestepping scheme is in use (and it almost always is in
  \fluidity), it is also necessary to specify solver options. 
\item[Diagnostic fields] are calculated from other fields without solving a
  partial differential equation. A typical example is the CFL number which
  may be calculated from the timestep, the mesh spacing and the velocity
  field. 
\item[Prescribed fields] receive their values from sources external to
  \fluidity. This might be a constant or varying function specified by the
  user, or it might be interpolated from some external data set. Fields such
  as diffusivity and viscosity are often prescribed as are source and
  absorption terms.
\end{description}

\subsection{Meshes}\label{Sect:Element}

Every field is associated with a mesh. The mesh defines the discrete
function space in which the field's values lie. For example, the mesh
defines what degree of polynomials are employed on each element, whether the
field is continuous or discontinuous between elements, and whether the
domain is periodic in any direction. 

Meshes are defined in the flml file by \option{/geometry/mesh} options. The
mesh associated with each field is referred to by name in the
\option{\ldots/mesh} option under that field.

\subsubsection{Reading meshes from file}
\index{mesh!input}
There must always be one mesh which is read in from a set of files in
triangle format. This is usually the \option{CoordinateMesh}. To specify the
triangle files from which the coordinate mesh should be read, set the
\option{file\_name} attribute of
\option{/geometry/dimension/mesh::CoordinateMesh/from\_file} to the basename
of the triangle files (that is, the filename without .node, .ele etc.)

The coordinate mesh read in from file will always have linear elements and
the Coordinate field is always continuous between elements.

For information on generating meshes in triangle format, see chapter
\ref{chap:meshes}. 

\subsubsection{Deriving meshes from other meshes}
\index{mesh!derived}
The alternative to reading a mesh from a file is to derive it from another
mesh. This is necessary when for instance we wish to derive a mesh with
different continuity or elements from the original mesh. 
For example, if we have a \option{CoordinateMesh} as our input mesh read 
from file, it is possible to derive a \option{VelocityMesh} from it
by adding \option{/geometry/mesh::VelocityMesh}, selecting 
\option{from\_mesh} under it and there selecting
\option{mesh::CoordinateMesh}. If nothing further is specified 
under the new mesh, the derived mesh will be exactly the same as the mesh
it is derived from.

The more interesting case occurs where we wish to derive a mesh with
different continuity or elements from the original mesh. To specify a
discontinuous mesh, under \option{\ldots/from\_mesh} enable
\option{mesh\_continuity} and select \option{discontinuous}.

Similarly, to specify a mesh with higher polynomial degree elements, enable
\option{mesh\_shape} under \option{\ldots/from\_mesh} and set
\option{polynomial\_degree}.

Meshes with any name can be added. Only the name \option{CoordinateMesh} 
is special, as it will be used to store the coordinates of the mesh. This 
is also the only required mesh. \option{VelocityMesh} and \option{PressureMesh}
are only provided as suggested names as quite often the pressure 
and velocity fields need to be on a different mesh 
than the coordinate mesh, e.g. for \PoDGPt. It is however 
not required that the velocity is defined on a mesh with the name
\option{VelocityMesh}, nor does the pressure field have to be on a mesh
with the name \option{PressureMesh}. If for instance the mesh needed 
for pressure is the same as your \option{CoordinateMesh}, e.g. 
for \Poo or \Pzero\Pone, the pressure can be defined directly on
the \option{CoordinateMesh} and no extra mesh is needed.

\subsubsection{Extruded meshes}\label{sect:extruded_meshes}
\index{mesh!extruded}

Given a 2D mesh file in triangle format, fluidity can extrude this mesh to create a layered three dimensional mesh on which simulations can be performed. This is achieved
by checking the extrude option under \ldots/from mesh. After checking this option, the user must specify a bottom\_depth and a sizing\_function (which specifies the separation
between layers). These distances can currently be entered as a constant, a generic\_function or
as a python function. Optionally, the user can then set the surface id given to the top and bottom surfaces. 

As well as extruding 2D meshes (where only the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are specified in the triangle file), given a pseudo 2D mesh on a spherical shell, fluidity can perform
and extrusion in the radial direction. To perform such an extrusion simply enable the options as noted above and additionally check the geometry/spherical\_earth option. With
this option enabled fluidity will then perform the specified extrusion towards the center of the sphere.

\subsubsection{Periodic meshes}
\index{mesh!periodic} \index{periodic domain} Periodic meshes are those that
are ``virtually'' connected in one or more directions. To make a periodic
mesh you must first create a triangle file where the edges that are periodic
can be mapped exactly by a simple transformation. For example, if the mesh
is periodic in the X-direction, the two edges must have nodes at exactly the
same height on each side. This can be easily accomplished using the
create\_aligned\_mesh script in the scripts folder.

To specify a periodic domain in Diamond, add a new mesh under
\option{/geometry/mesh}.  Select \onlypdf\linebreak
\option{\ldots/from\_mesh/mesh::CoordinateMesh} and then turn
on \onlypdf\\
\option{\ldots/from\_mesh/periodic\_boundary\_conditions} for each dimension
that is periodic. There are three fields that need to be completed: the
surface IDs of one side, the surface IDs of the opposite side and a python
function (\option{coordinate\_map}) which contains the necessary mapping
function.

For example, suppose that the domain is the unit square shown in figure
\ref{fig:periodic}\ which is to be periodic in the $x$ direction. We
designate surface ID 1 as the \emph{physical boundary}\ and surface ID 2 as the
\emph{aliased boundary}. We therefore enter 1 in
\option{\ldots/physical\_boundary\_ids}\ and 2 in
\option{\ldots/aliased\_boundary\_ids}. The \emph{coordinate map}\ function
takes a point on the \emph{aliased}\ boundary to the corresponding point on
the \emph{physical}\ boundary. In this case, the appropriate function is:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def val(X,t):
    result = list(X)
    result[0]=result[0]-1.0
    return result
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \xfig{configuring_fluidity_images/periodic_domain}
  \caption{Periodic unit square with surface IDs 1-4 shown.}
  \label{fig:periodic}
\end{figure}

Meshes that are required to be periodic can now be derived from this periodic mesh.

\index{Zoltan}\index{parallel!periodic domains}
Running a periodic mesh in parallel is relatively straight forward. To begin with, fluidity must be compiled with Zoltan. To check if the Zoltan libaries are installed type:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
dpkg -l libzoltan*
\end{lstlisting}

If the libaries are not present install them with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
sudo apt-get install libzoltan-dev
\end{lstlisting}

Then configure fluidity with zoltan:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./configure --with-zoltan
\end{lstlisting}

To produce the periodic meshes you have to use two tools (these tools are built as part of the fltools build target (see section \ref{sect:fltools})):

\begin{itemize}
\item periodise
\item flredecomp
\end{itemize}

The input to periodise is your flml (in this case foo.flml), which contains the mapping for the periodic boundary as described above. Run using the command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
./myfluidity/bin/periodise foo.flml
\end{lstlisting}

The output is a new flml called  foo\_periodised.flml. Then run flredecomp (section \ref{sect:flredecomp}) to decompose the mesh for the number of processors required.

\subsection{Setting field values}\label{Sect:setting_field_values}
\index{field!values}
\index{initial conditions!setting}
Field values must be specified by the user in two circumstances: the initial
value of most prognostic fields and the value throughout the simulation of
all prescribed fields. 

The initial value of prognostic fields is set with the
\option{\ldots/prognostic/initial\_condition} option while the value of
prescribed fields is set with the \option{\ldots/prescribed/value} option.

\subsubsection{Constant fields}
\index{field!constant}
Fields which are constant in space and (for prescribed fields) time may be
specified by simply providing a constant value in the \option{constant}
option under \option{\ldots/prognostic/initial\_condition},
\option{\ldots/prescribed/value}. For a scalar field, this is a single
floating point (real) value while for a vector field this is a list of reals
of length equal to the field dimension.

For tensor valued fields there are more options. It is possible to specify
an isotropic, or rotation invariant, value by choosing
\option{\ldots/value/isotropic/constant} and specifying a single real which
will be used for all the diagonal entries of the tensor field at all mesh
nodes. The off-diagonal entries of an isotropic tensor field are always
zero. A constant anisotropic field may be specified by choosing
\option{\ldots/value/anisotropic\_asymmetric/constant} and providing the
entire matrix. Finally, a constant symmetric anisotropic tensor field may be
specified by selecting \onlypdf\linebreak
\option{\ldots/value/anisotropic\_symmetric/constant}. In this case, the
user must specify all of the entries in the upper half of the matrix and
those in the lower half will be filled automatically by symmetry.

\subsubsection{Setting fields with a Python function}\label{Sect:setting_with_python}
\index{field!Python function}
\index{Python!prescribed field values}
The value of a field which varies in space and (for prescribed fields) in
time may be specified by providing an appropriate function written in
Python. The Python function will be evaluated for each node in the mesh at
the start of the simulation to populate the field values. For time-varying
prescribed fields, the function will be evaluated again at the beginning of
every timestep to update the field value. If it is known that the value of
the field does not in fact vary in time, then the re-evaluation of the
Python function on each timestep can be inhibited by setting the
\onlypdf\linebreak \option{\ldots/prescribed/do\_not\_recalculate} option.

The Python function must be provided as the value of the
\option{\ldots/python} option which may be chosen as an alternative to the
\option{\ldots/constant} function. The option may contain any Python code
but it must define a function \lstinline[language=Python]+val(X,t)+ where
the sequence \lstinline[language=Python]+X+ is the coordinates of the point
at which the field is being evaluated and \lstinline[language=Python]+t+ is
the current time. 

For a scalar field, the function must return a single floating point
value. Similarly for a vector field, a sequence of values of length equal to
the field dimension must be returned. For a tensor field, there are two
cases. For an isotropic field specified with
\option{\ldots/value/isotropic/python}, the function must return a single
float which will be used for all the diagonal entries of the tensor at that
point. The off-diagonal entries will be set to zero. For the anisotropic case,
the function must return a two-dimensional array (a sequence of
sequences). It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the tensor is
symmetric in cases where it should be.

\begin{example}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def val(X,t):
    return (-X[1],X[0])
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{A Python function returning a two-dimensional solid rotating
    vector field about the origin.}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def val(X,t):
    from numpy import matrix
    from math import sqrt
    dx= (matrix(X)-matrix((-0.5,0)))
    r=sqrt(dx*dx.T)
    if (r<0.25):
        return 1.0
    else:
        return 0    
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{A Python function returning a scalar tracer value which is 1.0 in
  a disk of radius 0.25 about the point (-0.5,0) and zero elsewhere. This
  example illustrates that it is possible to use a range of Python commands
  including importing modules.}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def val(X,t):
   t_ramp=50.
   if t<t_ramp:
       scale=t/t_ramp
   else:
       scale=1.
   return [[scale*100, 0, 0],
           [0, scale*100, 0],
           [0, 0, scale*1.e-3]]
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{A Python function returning a tensor which might be a typical
    three-dimensional diffusivity. The diffusivity ramps up from zero over
    the first 50 time units.}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Reading fields from a file}
\index{field!input}
A field can be populated using saved data from a file. This is intended primarily
for picking up prescribed fields from previously run prognostic simulations
(checkpointing) and may be specified by providing the file name in
the \option{from\_file} option under \option{\ldots/prognostic/initial\_condition},
\option{\ldots/prescribed/value}.

For prescribed fields the format of the input file containing field data must be
vtu, and this will only work for those prescribed fields directly underneath
\option{\ldots/material\_phase}. For prognostic fields it is possible to select
the type of input file, under \option{\ldots/initial\_condition/from\_file/format};
the available supported formats for this include \option{vtu} and \option{NetCDF-CF 1.x}.

The file mesh must match the mesh of this field (except for piecewise constant
fields which will be remapped back from the discontinuous nodal values). In
parallel the process number is appended to the filename, e.g. if the file name
attribute is set to \option{input.vtu}, process 0 reads from \option{input-0.vtu}.

\subsubsection{Setting fields from NEMO data}\label{Sect:setting_from_nemo}
\index{field!from Nemo}
Initial conditions of prognostic fields and the values of prescribed fields can also be set from an external NEMO
data file. The external data file is in the NETCDF format and data is currently available for pressure, temperature, salinity
and velocity. To set the initial condition of a prognostic field from NEMO data, chose the option 
\option{\ldots/prognostic/initial\_condition/NEMO\_data} and then under \option{format} select the required data format. For scalar fields
the formats available are `Temperature', `Salinity' and `Free-surface height', for vector fields `Velocity' is the only available format.
Setting the value of prescribed fields from NEMO data works similarly. Set the option \option{\ldots/prescribed/value/NEMO\_data} and then proceed as above.

\subsection{Region IDs}
\index{region ID}
If the input mesh defines a number of region IDs then these may be employed
to specify different field values for each region. For a prescribed field,
this is achieved by changing the \option{\ldots/value::WholeMesh} element to
the unnamed \option{\ldots/value}. The user must then specify a new name for
that value element. Next, enable the  \option{\ldots/value/region\_ids}
option and set it to a list of region ids to which this value should
apply. Any number of  \option{\ldots/value} elements may be added to allow
different values to be specified in different regions. For prognostic
fields, analogous behaviour for initial conditions may be achieved by
switching \option{\ldots/initial\_condition} from \option{WholeMesh} to a
user-specified name and specifying the region IDs appropriately.

See section \ref{sect:region_ids}\ for information on including region IDs
in meshes.

\subsection{Mathematical constraints on initial conditions}\label{Sect:ICs}

For well-posedness, the initial condition of the velocity field must
satisfy both continuity (\ref{conty}) and the boundary conditions
imposed on the problem. If the normal component of velocity is
imposed on the entire boundary then the additional
compatibility constraint of global mass conservation must be
satisfied:
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\partial\Omega}\bmn\cdot\bmu=0.
\end{equation*}

\section{The options tree}\label{Sect:OptionsTree}
The top level of the options tree contains the following compulsory elements:

\begin{itemize}
\item Simulation Name
\item Problem Type
\item Geometry
\item IO
\item Timestepping
\item Physical Parameters
\item Material/Phase
\end{itemize}

The first six of these are described here.

\subsection{Simulation Name}
The simulation name is the base name for all output files. For example if you set the simulation name to foo then your statistics output file will be called foo.stat

\subsection{Problem Type}
Setting problem type gives fluidity a hint as to what sort of simulation you are conducting and therefore what combinations of options are likely to be valid. If you do not know which category applies to your problem, choose "fluids". 
\subsection{Geometry}
This element contains all the options required to specify the geometry of the mesh and the accuracy of the finite element discretisation.

\subsubsection{Dimension}
\index{dimension}
The dimension of the domain of your problem. For most users this should be
set to 3. Be careful, once you set the dimension you can't change it again!
This is necessary to ensure that all vectors and tensors are of the correct
dimension.

\subsubsection{Meshes}
Meshes are the finite element spaces on which your problem is solved. Meshes are either read from file or are derived from other meshes. Mesh options are described in detail in section~\ref{Sect:Element}.

\subsubsection{Quadrature}
\index{quadrature!options}
\fluidity\ uses numerical quadrature to integrate the equations over each
element. There is a performance/accuracy trade off in quadrature: the more
quadrature points that are employed, the more accurate the integrals are but
the more expensive the assembly operation is. Quadrature rules in \fluidity
are categorised by the degree of polynomial which they will integrate
exactly. The higher the degree of the quadrature rule, the more quadrature
points which will be employed. As a general rule of thumb, the quadrature
degree employed should be at least $\max(2n_{\vec{u}+1},2n_p)$ where
$n_{\vec{u}}$ is the degree of the elements employed for velocity and $n_p$
is the degree of the elements employed for pressure. This means that degree
4 quadrature is sufficient for most of the fluidity configurations currently
in use.

The quadrature degree is specified by setting \option{/geometry/quadrature/degree}.

\subsubsection{Spherical Earth}
To be written...

\subsubsection{Ocean Boundaries}
\index{boundary conditions!ocean}
These options are required if you are running an ocean simulation with a
free surface or with various other ocean options which require the code to
know where the ocean surface and bed lie.
\option{/geometry/ocean\_boundaries/top\_surface\_ids} and
\onlypdf\linebreak\option{/geometry/ocean\_boundaries/bottom\_surface\_ids}
are lists of boundary tags from your input mesh which lie on the ocean
surface and bed respectively.

It is not usually necessary to change the settings for either of the scalar fields under this option. 

\subsection{IO}
These options control the frequency and form of model outputs.
\subsubsection{Dump format}
\index{vtk}
The file format of used to output fields to disk. At this stage, vtu is the
only allowed format.

\subsubsection{Dump period}
This is the interval between the state fields being output to disk. You should usually start by setting this to a rather low value (possibly as short as your timestep) for testing and then increase it for production runs once you know your configuration works. The value can be specified as either a constant or python function.

It is possible to swap \option{/io/dump\_period} for \option{/io/dump\_period\_in\_timesteps} to specify that you wish to have a dump every fixed number of timesteps.

\subsubsection{Output mesh}
\index{mesh!output}

All fields will be interpolated onto the same mesh for output. Usually the
CoordinateMesh is the right choice. If you have fields that are 
higher order than the selected output mesh you will lose 
accuracy. Interpolating all fields to a higher order mesh for output may give
very large dump files however. If any 
of the fields in the output is discontinous, the mesh in the output file
will be a discontinuous version of the mesh selected here.

\subsubsection{Disable dump at start}

A dump is normally performed at the start of the simulation. This options disables that.

\subsubsection{Disable dump at end}

A dump is normally performed at the end of the simulation. This options disables that.

\subsubsection{CPU dump period}

This outputs dumps at specified CPU times. Not recommended.

\subsubsection{Wall time dump period}

Outputs at specified walltime periods. Not recommended.

\subsubsection{Max dump file count}

Limits the number of dumps by overwriting the previous dumps after the number specified here.

\subsubsection{Convergence}

You can check certain fields for convergence during nonlinear iterations.  To do this switch on \option{/timestepping/nonlinear\_iterations} and \option{/timestepping/nonlinear\_iterations/tolerance} and switch on the convergence option under the fields that you want to check for convergence. 

It is possible to enable the creation of a convergence file, giving details of the convergence of each field over the global nonlinear iteration loop. The .convergence file is in the same format as the .stat file. In order to do this, switch on 
\option{/io/convergence}  and \option{/io/convergence/convergence\_file}.  You still need the options in the above paragraph.

\subsubsection{Checkpointing}
\index{checkpointing} Enables checkpointing, which saves sufficient
information (including a new flml options file) to restart a simulation. You
must specify how often to checkpoint in terms of the number of dumps. There
are also options to checkpoint at the start of the simulation and at the
end. This latter is useful when running on batch systems that have a time
limit.

Up to five sets of files are created when checkpointing from new options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mesh files - The from\_file meshes, in triangle format. Surface IDs
  and (if present) region IDs are written to the mesh files, and adaptivity
  is supported. In parallel a triangle mesh is written for each process.
\item Halo files (in parallel) - Halo information for each process.
\item Field files - A vtu is written for each mesh with prognostic fields in
  each state and (in parallel) for each process.
\item Checkpointed option file - A new FLML file, with the from\_file mesh
  set to read from the checkpoint mesh files and the prognostic fields set
  to initialise from the checkpoint field files.
\item Checkpointed detector files - Two files related to checkpointing of
  detectors are created.
\end{enumerate}

The first checkpointed detector file has the extension .groups and contains
a header with the names of the groups of detectors in the order they were
read in the simulation. It also contains information about the number of
detectors in each group. This is to guarantee that when restarting from a
checkpoint, the detectors will be read in the same order and consequently
will be saved in that same order into the output detector file for
consistency.  The second checkpointed detector file has the extension
.positions.dat and contains the last position of the detectors at the time 
of checkpointing in binary format.

No checkpointed detectors files will be created if only static detectors are
defined in Diamond, since the position of these detectors remains always the
same. This is mainly used when Lagrangian detectors are set that are
advected by the flow and hence, their position changes as the simulation
proceeds.

At the same time as creating the two files related to checkpointing of
detectors, the detector options in the options tree or Diamond are updated
so that in the new flml file the detectors are set to initialise from the
checkpoint detectors files \\
(\option{/io/detectors/detector\_array/from\_checkpoint\_file} or \\
\option{/io/detectors/lagrangian\_detector/from\_checkpoint\_file}). For
simplicity, the static detectors are also read from the checkpoint file that
contains the position of all detectors, static and Lagrangian
(\option{/io/detectors/static\_detector/from\_checkpoint\_file}).

Checkpoint filenames all end with [dump
no.]\_checkpoint[-[process]].[extension], where the process number is added
to the mesh, halo and field files in parallel.  The checkpoint detectors
filenames contain \_det after [dump no.]\_checkpoint.

\index{checkpointing!restarting}
To restart from a checkpoint, specify the checkpointed FLML file as input.

\subsubsection{Stat}
\index{stat file}
Contains additional options for handling stat files, for example outputting
a stat file at the start (timestep zero) and outputting stat data before and
after an adapt.

There are futher options under individual fields, for example to exclude data fro mthe stat file.

\subsubsection{Detectors}
\index{detectors!options}
Note that the algorithm used to determine the element containing a detector (of
any kind) assumes that the detector is known to be within the simulation domain.
For points outside the simulation domain the field values will be extrapolated
if within 0.1 (in ideal space) from any element, or set to zero otherwise.

Detectors are set in Diamond with the \option{/io/detectors} option. The detectors can be set to be static detectors, \option{/io/detectors/static\_detector}, Lagrangian detectors \\
\option{/io/detectors/lagrangian\_detector} or an array of detectors, \\
\option{/io/detectors/detector\_array}.

When choosing to set detectors using an array, the total number of detectors
needs to be specified in
\option{/io/detectors/detector\_array/number\_of\_detectors} and the type of
detectors is indicated with the option
\option{/io/detectors/detector\_array/static} or \\
\option{/io/detectors/detector\_array/lagrangian}.

\index{Python!detector positions}
Examples \ref{examp:python_function_detectors} and
\ref{examp:python_function_detectors_1} illustrate the use of a Python
function to set an array of detectors, that can be static or Lagrangian.

\begin{example}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def val(t):
            import math

            ret=[]
            for i in range(100):
                    ret.append([-2.5,(-0.495 + i * 0.01)])

            return ret
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{A Python function setting 100 detectors. This
  example illustrates that it is possible to use a Python function to set an array of detectors.}
  \label{examp:python_function_detectors}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def val(t):
            import math

            ret=[]
            for k in range(100,2000,100):
                for j in range(7000,25100,100):
	               for i in range(7000,25100,100):
		             ret.append([i,j,k])

	return ret
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{A Python function setting 622459 detectors uniformly distributed
    at intervals of 100 m in the three orthogonal directions. They cover 19 z planes, from z=100 to z=1900, with 32761 detectors in each plane, from
    x=7000 to x=25000 and y=7000 to y=25000.}
  \label{examp:python_function_detectors_1}
\end{example}

The output of the detectors is an ascii file called
\option{name\_of\_simulation.detectors} where the name of the simulation has
been indicated in \option{/simulation\_name}. If binary output
\option{/io/detectors/} \option{binary\_output} option is set then the file is called
\option{name\_of\_simulation.detectors.dat} and in this case \option{name\_of\_simulation.detectors} contains only the header with the
information about the detectors (name of each detector, in which column the
position of each detector is stored, etc.).

\subsubsection{Log output}

Enables additional output to the screen or log file. Usually controlled
using the -v option when running \fluidity. However, a useful option for
logging memory diagnostics can be switched on here.

\subsection{Timestepping}
\index{time!step}
These options control the start and end time of the simulation as well as options regarding timestep size.

\subsubsection{Current time}
This is the model time at the start of the simulation. In most cases this is likely to be zero.

\textbf{Time units}

If your simulation contains real data, for example when using
\option{ocean\_forcing}, \fluidity\ must know how to map simulated time onto
real time. This option allows the user to specify the ``real-world'' start
time of the simulation.  The input is a string of the form:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
seconds since 1992-10-8 15:15:42.5 -6:00 
\end{lstlisting} 

which indicates seconds since October 8th, 1992 at 3 hours, 15 minutes and
42.5 seconds in the afternoon in the time zone which is six hours to the
west of Coordinated Universal Time (i.e. Mountain Daylight Time). The time
zone specification can also be written without a colon using one or
two-digits (indicating hours) or three or four digits (indicating hours and
minutes).


\subsubsection{Timestep}
The simulation timestep. If adaptive timestepping is not used this will
define the size of the timestep used throughout the simulation.  If adaptive
timestepping is used this option defines only the size of the first
timestep.

\subsubsection{Finish time}
The model time at which the simulation should halt. Note that the simulation
may overrun slightly due to roundoff in calculating the current time or if
the timestep does not divide the simulation time exactly.

\subsubsection{Final timestep}

Rather than specify a finish time, the final timestep may be specified. This is the number of timestep after which the simulation will stop.

\subsubsection{CPU time limit}

This option will stop the simulation after the CPU time reaches this limit.
This option is useful when coupled with
\option{/io/checkpointing/checkpoint\_at\_end} enabled.

\subsubsection{Wall time limit}

This option will stop the simulation after the wall time (real time) reaches
this limit. This option is useful when coupled with
\option{/io/checkpointing/checkpoint\_at\_end} enabled.

\subsubsection{Nonlinear iterations}
Nonlinear quantities in the equations are represented by their last known
values. It may be necessary to solve the equations more than once to produce
better approximations to those last known values for reasons of accuracy or
stability. Unless there are reasons to do otherwise, set this value to 2.

\subsubsection{Adaptive timestep}

This option allows the timestep, $\Delta T$, to vary throughout the run, depending on the 
Courant-–Friedrichs-–Lewy (CFL) number.  There are several sub-options here. The
\option{\ldots/requested\_cfl} is the desired upper limit of the CFL. A value of 5-10 is usual
here. \fluidity will increase the timestep if the CFL number if less than this value and decrease
it if the CFL is greater than this. The \option{\ldots/minimum\_timestep} and 
\option{\ldots/maximim\_timestep} options limit the timestep. The option 
\option{\ldots/increase\_tolerance} determines
the rate of growth in the timestep. A value of 1.5 indicates the timestep can grow by
at most, 50\%. There is no limit on the rate of decrease. Note that if a timestep fails
to meet the CFL limit imposed it is not re-run, but the timestep is decreased for the next
iteration. Finally, a desired $\Delta T$ can be calculated at the first time iteration by
switching on the option: \option{\ldots/at\_first\_timestep}

\subsubsection{Steady state}
It is possible to run fludity until it converges to a steady state; this is sometimes useful for initialising a problem. In order to do this, switch on \option{/timestepping/steady\_state} and set a tolerance. 

\subsection{Physical parameters}
These options control global physical quantities.

\subsubsection{Gravity}
\index{gravity}
The importance of buoyancy is discussed in section \ref{sect:buoyancy}. This
required a gravitational field to be set and involves both its magnitude
(\eg \mss[9.8]) and a vector field specifying the direction in which gravity
points. For a 3D simulation in a flat domain with gravity pointing in the
negative z direction you would set \verb+value(WholeMesh)+ for this field to
the vector (0.0, 0.0, -1.0). For a gravitational force with spatially
varying direction, e.g. on the Earth considered in Cartesian space with
gravity pointing in the negative radial direction you could use a Python
function of the form
\begin{example}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def val(X, t):
   from math import sqrt
   radius=sqrt(X[0]**2+X[1]**2+X[2]**2)
   rx=X[0]/radius
   ry=X[1]/radius
   rz=X[2]/radius
   return (-rx, -ry, -rz)
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{A Python function returning a vector pointing in the negative radial direction.}
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Coriolis}
\index{Coriolis!options}

\fluidity\ supports the specification of the Coriolis term (section
\ref{sect:coriolis}) in a number of different ways. The following options
are available:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \option{f\_plane} -- a single float is prescribed which corresponds to
        $f_0$ in \eqref{eq:f-plane};
  \item \option{beta\_plane} -- here two floats are prescribed, $f_0$ and
        $\beta$ in \eqref{eq:beta-plane};
  \item \option{sine\_of\_latitude} -- here the Coriolis parameter from
        \eqref{eq:coriolis_parameters} is used and $\Omega$, 
        $R_{\textrm{earth}}$ and $\textrm{latitude}_0$ are defined as floats with
        latitude calculated via 
        $\phi = y/R_{earth} + \textrm{latitude}_0$;
  \item \option{on\_sphere} -- here $\Omega$ the rotation vector pointing in the
        inertial frame $z$ direction  \eqref{eq:on_sphere_rotation} is set,
        note this is the direction pointing from the centre of mass to the North
        Pole on the Earth;
 \item \option{python\_f\_plane} -- time dependent python input
       prescribing a single float which corresponds to
       $f_0$ in \eqref{eq:f-plane} - see example \ref{ex:python_f_plane}.
\end{enumerate}

Recall that there is a factor $2$ relationship between $f$ and $\Omega$
\eqref{eq:f_omega} --- make sure you don't get caught out by this.

\begin{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[language = Python]
if t < 4000.0:
  omega = 3.0
elif t < 6000.0:
  omega = 2.5
elif t < 8000.0:
  omega = 2.0
elif t < 10000.0:
  omega = 1.5
elif t < 12000.0:
  omega = 1.0
elif t < 14000.0:
  omega = 0.5
else:
  omega = 0.0

return 2.0 * omega
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\option{python\_f\_plane} definition, sweeping through a number of
         rotation rates. Note the factor of $2$ between $f$ and $\Omega$ (see
         equation \eqref{eq:f_omega}).}
\label{ex:python_f_plane}
\end{example}

\section{Material/Phase}
The final compulsory element in the top level of the options tree is
\option{/material\_phase}.  A \option{/material\_phase} element groups all
of the fields which pertain to one phase of one material. See
Chapter~\ref{chap:model_physics} for an explanation of the distinction
between a phase and material in this context.

When configuring ocean problems (or single material/single phase fluids
problems), only one \option{/material\_phase} is required.  Multi-material
and multi-phase problems will require one \option{/material\_phase} for each
phase or material in the problem.

Note that you must give each of your material phases a name.

% NOTE: if you add anything below the Sediments sections here, change the ref...
The following sections (\ref{config:spatial} to \ref{config:sediments}) describe the options below the
\option{/material\_phase} option.

\section{Advected quantities: momentum and tracers}
\label{config:spatial}

\subsection{Spatial discretisations}
\index{advection-diffusion equation!discretisation options}
\index{momentum equation!discretisation options}

A number of underlying finite element schemes are available for tracer
fields and velocity. In each case there are restrictions on the mesh
continuity which must be employed. In addition, the \onlypdf\linebreak
\option{conservative\_advection} option is applicable to all discretisation
types. See chapter \ref{chap:numerical_discretisation} for details.

For each field, the spatial discretisations can be selcted using
\option{\ldots/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation}.  Once selected a number
of other options will open underneath this option.

\subsubsection{Continuous Galerkin}

Continuous Galerkin (CG) implements the CG scheme detailed in \ref{sec:balancing_diffusion}. Once selected
the stabilisation method used, and what is included in the advection terms and mass terms need to be selected.

\subsubsection{Control volumes}

The Control Volume implements the advection scheme described in section [CROSS REF]. There are 
several options to control the face value and how diffusion is implemented. Face value can be set to one of:
\begin{description}
\item[First Order Upwind]
\item[Trapizoidal] requires an optional face value limiter
\item[Finite Element] requires an optional face value limiter
\item[HyperC] requires CFL number
\item[UltraC] requires CFL number along with a maximum and minimum target
\end{description}

For the diffusion scheme one can choose either Bassi Rebay or the element gradient method [CROSS REF].

\subsubsection{Discontinuous Galerkin}

The Discontinuous Galerkin option implements the advection-diffusion algorithm described in section [CROSS REF].
There are two options to set - the advection scheme and the diffusion scheme. The advection scheme can be one of upwind
or none. The diffusion scheme can be one of:
\begin{description}
\item[Bassi Rebay] The classical scheme of Bassi and Rebay  [REF]
\item[Compact DG] The compact discontinuous Galerkin scheme from Peraire and Persson [REF]
\item[Arbitrary upwind] Scheme in which upwinding is applied in alternating directions.
\item[Interior penalty] Classical interior penalty scheme
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Conservative advection}



\subsection{Temporal discretisations}
Under temporal discretisation, you can set the value of theta, where $0$ is explicit, $0.5$ is Crank-Nicolson and $1$ is implicit. For scalar fields, the control volumes option may be selected if you are using control volumes or coupled cv spatial discretisation. The discontimuous galerkin option can be used if you are using discontinuous galerkin spatial discretisation to set the maximum courant number per subcycle, or the number of subcyles. 

\subsection{Source and absorption terms}\label{Sect:Source}
\index{source terms}
\index{absorption terms}

The source and absorption terms allow for external forcing of the tracer and
momentum equations. The source is a rate of change of the tracer which is
independent of the system state while the absorption term is linear in the
tracer. That is to say, the source and absorption terms modify the tracer
equation as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = F(T,u,t) - AT + S
\end{equation}
where $F$ represents the advection and diffusion terms, $A$ is the
absorption and $S$ is the source. The source and absorption are usually
prescribed fields supplied by the user but in some cases it may be necessary
to provide a diagnostic field which will be set by a parameterisation
somewhere in the model. If this is the case then this will be specified in
the documentation of that parameterisation.

For tracer fields, the source and absorption are specified by the\onlypdf\\
\option{\ldots/scalar\_field/prognostic/scalar\_field::Source} and\onlypdf\\
\option{\ldots/scalar\_field/prognostic/scalar\_field::Absorption} options
respectively. For velocity, the corresponding fields are naturally
vector-valued and are set by options\onlypdf\linebreak
\option{\ldots/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/vector\_field::Source} and\onlypdf\\
\option{\ldots/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/vector\_field::Absorption}
respectively.

\subsection{Sponge regions}\label{Sect:Sponge}
\index{sponge regions}
It is often useful to be able to relax momentum or a field variable to a
given state in regions of the domain, typically in regions close to
boundaries. This may be done using a combination of source and absorption
terms. If $S$ is the value of the source at a point and $A$ is the
absorption, then the value of the tracer $T$ will tend to relax to a value
of $S/A$. The absorption, $A$, has units $1/\mathrm{time}$ and controls the
time over which the relaxation occurs.

\section{Solving for pressure}
\index{pressure!options}

\subsection{Geostrophic pressure solvers}
\index{pressure!geostrophic balance}

\subsection{Removing the null space of the pressure gradient operator} \label{Nullspaceremove}
\index{pressure!null space}

If the normal component of velocity is imposed on all boundaries then the
appropriate boundary condition for pressure 
\citep[see][]{gresho87} is obtained by taking the normal component of
(\ref{mtm}), this yielding a Neumann boundary condition for
pressure. This only serves to define the pressure field up to an
arbitrary additive constant.

There are two different and mutually exclusive options which may be used to
fix the additive constant in the pressure field. The first is that the
pressure at a single point may be set to 0. This is achieved by setting the
\option{\ldots/scalar\_field::Pressure/prognostic/reference\_node} option. The
value of the option is the number of a node at which the pressure is to be
constrained to be zero. It is an error for the node number specified here to
be greater than the number of nodes in the simulation.

The second method is to instruct the linear solver to remove the null space
of the pressure equation as a part of the solution procedure. This is
achieved by enabling the\linebreak
\option{\ldots/scalar\_field::Pressure/prognostic/solver/remove\_null\_space}
option. This approach often leads to better convergence rates than setting
the \option{reference\_node}.

If however there is a single location on the boundary where the normal
component of velocity is not specified then there is no free constant in the
pressure and neither \option{\ldots/reference\_node} nor
\option{\ldots/remove\_null\_space} should be set. An example
may be stress free outflow, or the presence of a free surface.

\section{Solution of linear systems}\label{Sect:Solve}
\index{linear solvers!options}

\subsection{Iterative Method}
\index{GMRES}
\index{conjugate gradient}
\index{multigrid}
\index{PETSc}
As described in Section \ref{ND_Linear_solvers}, for the solution of large sparse linear systems so called iterative methods are usually employed, as they avoid having to explicitly construct the inverse of the matrix, which is generally dense and therefore costly to compute (both in memory and computer time). FLUIDITY is linked to PETSc: a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations.  It employs the MPI standard for parallelism. FLUIDITY therefore supports any iterative method provided by the PETSc library (http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-2/snapshots/petsc-dev/docs/manualpages/KSP/KSPType.html --- available methods may depend on the PETSc library installed on your system). Examples include Conjugate Gradient (CG), GMRES and FGMRES (Flexible GMRES). Some options are explicitly listed under \option{solver/iterative\_method}, for example CG: \option{solver/iterative\_method::cg}, whereas others can be selected entering the name of the chosen scheme in \option{solver/iterative\_method}.

\subsection{Preconditioner}
\index{linear solvers!preconditioners}

The requirement for a suitable preconditioner is described in Section \ref{ND_Preconditioners}. In a manner analogous to the selection of the iterative method, some common preconditioning options are explicitly listed under \option{solver/preconditioner}, for example MG: \option{solver/preconditioner::mg}, whereas others can be selected by entering the name of the chosen scheme in \option{solver/preconditioner}. 

\subsubsection{Direct Solve}

Note that the option to solve a system exactly is available in FLUIDITY. For this, \option{solver/iterative\_method::preonly} must be selected (preonly -- preconditioner only) and the preconditioner must be set to \option{solver/preconditioner::LU}. A full LU decomposition of the system is then carried out.

\subsection{Relative Error}
\index{linear solvers!convergence criteria}

The solver finishes if the preconditioned error becomes smaller than the original preconditioned error times this value. 

\subsection{Absolute Error}

The solver finishes if the preconditioned error becomes smaller than this value.

\subsection{Max Iterations}

The maximum number of iterations allowed for the linear solver, before quitting.

\subsection{Start from Zero}

Switch on to start a solve with a zero vector and not a guess from a previous solve. Note that some solves always start at zero in which case this switch will have no effect (to check this, the user should refer to the log output). 

\subsection{Remove Null Space}

As documented in Section \ref{Nullspaceremove}, this option removes the null space.

\subsection{Solver Failures}
\index{errors!linear solver}

Three options are available here:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Never ignore solver failures: Solver failures are always treated as fatal errors. The model stops at the end of the time step in order to allow for the latest output to be written. 
\item Ignore non-convergence during spin-up: Allow for an initial period in which solver failures caused by non-convergence in the maximum number of iterations are ignored. 
\item Ignore all solver failures: Ignore all solver failures. This is a dangerous option that should only be used in exceptional cases. 
\end{enumerate}

It is recommended that users use the first option: Never ignore solver failures, however, on occasions (e.g. challenging initial conditions) the second might also be applicable. 

\subsection{Reordering RCM}

A bandwidth reduction algorithm --- reverse Cuthill-McKee reordering --- is used to improve cache performance.

\subsection{Solver Diagnostics}

This subsection includeds a series of extra diagnostic options to help debug solver problems. 

\subsubsection{Print norms}
Print out the norm of vectors and matrices before the solve, and that of the solution vector afterwards. Norms are printed at verbosity level 2, so run \fluidity\ with -v2 or -v3.

\subsubsection{Monitors}
Options to give extra information for each iteration of the the solve. Note that some of those may really slow down your computation. 


\section{Equation of State (EoS)}\label{Sect:ConfigEOS}
\index{equation of state!options}

The equation of state is a relation between state 
variables. For incompressible flows it is used to derive the density
from other variables such as temperature and salinity. For compressible
flows it can be a more general relation between the state variables
including density and pressure.

There are two ``fluids'' equations of state available and one ``multimaterial'' EOS:

\begin{description}
\item\option{\ldots/equation\_of\_state/fluids/linear} 
Is a simple linear equation of state,
where density is a function of temperature and salinity.

\item\option{\ldots/equation\_of\_state/fluids/ocean\_pade\_approximation} Is a complex EOS for ocean modelling where density is a function of temperature, salinity and pressure.
\item\option{\ldots/equation\_of\_state/multimaterial/miegrunneisen} Is simple compressible material EOS.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Linear fluid EOS}
\index{equation of state!linear}
The density is a linear function of temperature and salinity:
\begin{equation}
  \rho=\rho_0 \left(1-\alpha(T-T_0)+\beta (S-S_0)\right),
\end{equation}
where $\rho_0, \alpha, T_0, \beta$ and $S_0$ are set by the following 
options:
\begin{description}
\item \option{\ldots/linear/reference\_density} sets $\rho_0$
\item \option{\ldots/linear/temperature\_dependency/thermal\_expansion\_coefficient} sets $\alpha$
\item \option{\ldots/linear/temperature\_dependency/reference\_temperature} sets $T_0$
\item \option{\ldots/linear/salinity\_dependency/salinity\_contraction\_coefficient} sets $\beta$
\item \option{\ldots/linear/salinity\_dependency/reference\_salinity} sets $S_0$
\end{description}
Note that for Boussinesq the reference density does not 
influence any of the terms in the 
momentum equation (see \eqref{boussinesq}). It may influence the outcome
of diagnostic fields depending on density.

The option \option{subtract\_out\_hydrostatic\_level} only changes 
the buoyancy term. For LinearMomentum it changes to 
$g(\rho-\rho_0)$ and does not affect the density in the $Du/Dt$ term. For
Boussinesq it changes to 
$g\rho'=g(\rho-\rho_0)/\rho_0$ (again see \eqref{boussinesq}), 
and this option should always be used.
In both cases the diagnostic
``Density'' field and all other diagnostic fields depending on density
still represent the full density.

\subsubsection{Pade ocean EOS}
\index{equation of state!Pade approximation}
This EOS is described in section~\ref{Sect:PadeDescription}.
This option uses mean hydrostatic pressure based on depth to calculate the
pressure (hence why you need to provide the value of z on the top surface.
For this option, the temp field represents potential temperature \emph{not} in
situ temperature - so beware (see \citet{mcdougall2003} for a formula for converting
from in-situ to potential). The units are degrees Centigrade for potential
temperature, \PSU{} for salt, \kgmm{} for density. The reference density is
\kgmm[1000] and the momentum equation is Boussinesq using this reference density.

\subsubsection{Multi-material compressible EOS}
\index{equation of state!stiffened gas}
\option{\ldots/equation\_of\_state/multimaterial/miegrunneisen} defines a simple compressible equation of state that can be used to describe gases, liquids and solids, known as the Mie-Gruneisen (or stiffened gas) EOS (see section~\ref{Sect:StiffenedGas}).

\begin{description}
\item\option{\ldots/miegrunneisen/reference\_density} Specifies the reference density of the material in SI units.
\item\option{\ldots/miegrunneisen/ratio\_specific\_heats} Specifies the ratio of specific heats of the gas minus 1 $(c_p/c_V-1)$ in the perfect gas EOS and the Gruneisen parameter in the stiffened gas equation of state. Not activating this option simplifies the compressible EOS to that of a compressible liquid.
\item\option{\ldots/miegrunneisen/bulk\_sound\_speed\_squared} Specifies the bulk sound speed squared for the material $c_B^2$. Not activating this option simplifies the compressible EOS to that of a perfect gas.
\end{description}

\section{Subgridscale Parameterisations}

\fluidity\ contains a number of subgridscale parameterisations which model physical process below the resolution of the mesh.

\subsection{GLS}

This option enables the model described in section \ref{Sec:GLS}. There are a few different 
sub-options to configure. First, you must choose which GLS method to use 
from $k-\epsilon$, $k-kl$, $k-\omega$ and $gen$. Next, the stability functions
can be chosen. CanutoA or CanutoB are recommended. If you are running a 3D model, then switching on the 
\option{\ldots/calculate\_boundaries} is recommended. You must also enable 
\option{/geometry/ocean\_boundaries}. Finally, you can enable a number of optional diagnostic fields.
There is also an option, \option{\ldots/calculate\_boundaries/fix\_surface\_values} which imposes
quasi-Diriclet boundary conditions on the diagnostic fields. This option is useful when using adaptivity
and GLS.

The user can also choose to relax the diffusivity and viscosity calculated by switching on the\linebreak

\option{\ldots/relax\_diffusivity}. The value specified must be between 0 and 1.0. A value of 0 indicates
no relaxation, 1.0 would indicate no changes to be made. If this option is activated, the diagnostic fields
\option{GLSTurbulentVerticalDiffusivity} and \option{GLSTurbulentVerticalViscosity} must also
be activated. In addition, if adaptivity is enabled, these two fields must have an interpolation
method set, e.g. \option{\ldots/GLSVerticalViscosity/diagnostic/consistent\_interpolation}.

For each field that will be effected by the subgrid scale parameterisations, 
you must enable the correct diffusivity. This
is done by specifying \option{\ldots/subgridscale\_parameterisation} in the
field to \option{GLS}. Normally, this would be the temperature, salinity and any biology fields active.

Finally, a fields that are altered by the GLS model, such as the Viscosity need to be switched
to a \option{diagnostic/algotiyhm::Internal}-type field. The list of fields to switch is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \option{GLSTurbulentKineticEnergy/Diffusivity}
\item \option{GLSTurbulentKineticEnergy/Source}
\item \option{GLSTurbulentKineticEnergy/Absorption}
\item \option{GLSGenericSecondQuantity/Diffusivity}
\item \option{GLSGenericSecondQuantity/Source}
\item \option{GLSGenericSecondQuantity/Absorption}
\item \option{Velocity/Viscosity}
\end{enumerate}

If these fields are not set correctly, a user error will occur.

\section{Boundary conditions}\label{Sect:BCs_configure}
\index{boundary conditions}

The simulated system requires suitable boundary conditions for full closure.
An example could be the amount of sunlight at the ocean surface, a specified value of
temperature heating material from below, or a momentum stress in the form of wind for velocity.
It is also possible to leave boundary conditions undefined, in which case "stress-free" conditions are
applied. See section \ref{Sect:BCs} for further details.

\subsection{Adding a boundary condition}\label{Sect:BCs:adding}

Boundary conditions are set for each field contained in state under \option{\ldots/boundary\_conditions}. 
Multiple boundary conditions can be set for each field, such that the sides, surface and bottom can 
have different conditions. There is only one exception to this which are the \option{/ocean\_forcing} 
boundary conditions which are set globally. A boundary conditions is added by clicking the "+" symbol
in the appropriate field

\subsection{Selecting surfaces}\label{Sect:BCs:selecting}
\index{surface ID}

When generating the mesh it is possible to specify regions and surfaces (see
section \ref{sect:surface_ids}). These surface IDs can be used to specify which surfaces
a boundary conditions applies to. For example if the top and bottom of your mesh is defined as surface
1, then simply add a one to \option{\ldots/boundary\_conditions/surface\_ids}. Multiple surfaces 
can be added, separated by a space.

\subsection{Boundary condition types}\label{Sect:BCs:types}
\index{boundary conditions!setting}

\subsubsection{Dirichlet}
\index{boundary conditions!Dirichlet}

A Dirichlet condition sets the value of the field at each location over the surface $\partial\Omega$:
\begin{equation*}
y(\bmx) = f(\bmx), \;\textrm{on}\; \partial\Omega
\end{equation*}

Dirichlet boundary conditions can also be applied weakly by selecting the \option{\ldots/apply\_weakly}
option. Unlike the strong form of the Dirichlet conditions, weak Dirichlet
conditions do not force the solution on the boundary to be pointwise equal
to the boundary condition. 

\subsubsection{Neumann}
\index{boundary conditions!Neumann}

A Neumann boundary condition sets the derivative to the normal ($n$) of the surface, $\partial\Omega$:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial n} = \hat{\vec{n}}\cdot\nabla y = f(\bmx), \;\textrm{on}\;  \partial\Omega
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Robin}
\index{boundary conditions!Robin}

A Robin boundary conditions are a weighted combination of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary 
conditions:
\begin{equation*}
\alpha y + \beta\frac{\partial y}{\partial n} = f(\bmx), \;\textrm{on}\;  \partial\Omega
\end{equation*}

for two constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In \fluidity\ these correspond to the \option{\ldots/order\_zero\_coefficient}
and the \option{\ldots/order\_one\_coefficient} respectively.

\subsubsection{Zero flux}
\index{boundary conditions!zero flux}

For control volume discretisations only this options prevents the field fluxing from the boundary.

\subsubsection{Free surface}
\index{boundary conditions!free surface}
\index{free surface!boundary condition}

The \option{\ldots/order\_zero\_coefficient} option allows the height of upper surface to vary according
to the pressure and velocity fields. This boundary condition is available on the velocity field only. It is
recommended you activate a diagnostic Free Surface field also.

\subsubsection{Drag}
\index{boundary conditions!drag}

Applies a quadratic or linear drag to the Velocity field. Both the value and the type of drag need to be set.

\subsubsection{Wind forcing}
\index{boundary conditions!wind stress}
\index{wind forcing}

A wind forcing can be applied to the Velocity field as either a stress or
velocity. For stress values, the physical units should match those of the
simulation, so for example, if you use the non-dimensional value of $\rho$
as 1.0, your stresses (in \unit{kgm\ensuremath{^{-1}}s\ensuremath{^{-2}}})
should be divided by the reference density (1000).  If using wind velocity
(at 10m height) the density of the air needs to be specified in the same
units, i.e. $\rho_{\textrm{air}} = 1.3\times10^{-3}$.

Alternatively
\option{\ldots/Velocity/boundary\_conditions/wind\_forcing/wind\_stress}
sets the value of wind forcing from a NETCDF file. The NETCDF file must
contain East-West and North-South components, along with times locations
(latitude/longitude) for the values. In addition, one must set
\option{/timestepping/current\_time/time\_units} in order for the simulated
time to be matched to the NETCDF data.

\subsubsection{No normal flow}
\index{boundary conditions!no normal flow}

When using \option{\ldots/control\_volumes} under Pressure \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation} or when using 
\option{\ldots/integrate\_continuity\_by\_parts} with CG Pressure and Velocity this boundary condition type 
imposes a weak no normal flow boundary condition on the surfaces specified.

\subsubsection{Near-wall treatment}

This option implements a penalty function for the near wall region, negating the need to use fine meshes
near walls \citet{bazilevs2007}. This option should be used in conjunction with a 
\option{\ldots/no\_normal\_flow} boundary on the same surface.

\subsubsection{Log-law of wall}

This option sets the velocity to proportional to the logarithm of the distance from the boundary. 
A surface roughness needs to be specified which is the thickness of laminar sublayer.

\subsection{Specialised boundaries}\label{Sect:BCs:special}

\option{\ldots/from\_file} allows the specification of a single file
containing something useful. This option is available on the Pressure, Free
Surface

\index{boundary conditions!NEMO data}
\option{\ldots/NEMO\_data} will set the field according to a specified NEMO
input file. This option is available for the Pressure (Free Surface) field.
In order to use this option a prescribed field containing NEMO pressure
field data must first be created. See section \ref{Sect:setting_from_nemo}
for information on setting prescribed fields from NEMO data. Then, under
\ldots/NEMO\_data/field\_name, set the string to that of the prescribed
field containing the NEMO pressure data to enable this option.

\option{\ldots/synthetic\_eddy\_method} does stuff. Available for velocity.

\subsection{Special cases}\label{Sect:BCs:special}

There are a few special cases of boundary conditions that are not applied
using the methods described above.  These include ocean surface forcing and
the boundary conditions on the General Length Scale (GLS) turbulence model.

\subsubsection{Ocean surface forcing}\label{Sect:BCs:special:oceans}
\index{boundary conditions!ocean}

Ocean surface forcing takes parameters from ERA40 datasets, passes them
through bulk formulae and gives a boundary condition for the salinity,
temperature, photosynthetic radiation and velocity fields. The settings for
these options are in \option{/ocean\_forcing}. However, you must also set up
\option{/timestepping/current\_time/time\_units} and
\option{/geometry/ocean\_boundaries}.

Under \option{/ocean\_forcing} an input file and a mesh must be defined. One or more of the surface
fluxes can then be turned on. The input file must contain the following ERA40 parameters for the
duration of the simulated time:
\begin{itemize}
 \item 10 metre U wind component (\ms)
 \item 10 metre V wind component (\ms)
 \item \m[2] temperature (\K)
 \item Surface solar radiation downward (\unit{Wm\ensuremath{^{-2}}s})
 \item Surface thermal radiation downward (\unit{Wm\ensuremath{^{-2}}s})
 \item Total precipitation (\unit{ms})
 \item Run off (\unit{ms})
 \item \m[2] dew point temperature (\K)
 \item Mean sea-level pressure (\Pa)
\end{itemize}

These variables are surface variables on data defined on the ERA40 website. Note that some parameters are accumulated values
and as such are required to be divided by the ERA40 temporal resolution - \fluidity assumes 6 hour temporal resolution. 
These parameters are used as input to the bulk forcing formulae of \citet{large2004} included in \fluidity.

Other options under ocean surface forcing include specifying a latitude and longitude, and using a single position for the
forcing data. These options are only really useful when simulating pseudo-1D columns (see the gls-StationPapa test for an example
of a pseudo-1D column). Enabling the \option{position} option allows the user to specify a latitude and longitude as
a two real numbers (e.g. 50.0 -145.0 for 50$^\circ$ N and 145$^\circ$ W). These co-ordinates are translated into cartesian
co-ordinates, which are then added to the positions of the surface of the mesh. This allows the use of simple mesh geometries
and co-ordinates, whilst still specifying where the forcing data should originate. Moreover, the \option{single\_location}
option forces \emph{all} surface nodes to receive the same forcing.

Finally, it is possible to output the fluxes that are imposed on the ocean surface, by enabling the
\option{output\_fluxes\_diagnostic} option. Here, the user can enable diagnostic fields for momentum, heat, salinity and
photosynthetic radiation downwards. The fluxes will then be included in the output as normal scalars or vectors, but with values
confied to the upper surface.

\subsubsection{GLS subgridscale parameterisation}\label{Sect:BCs:special:gls}
\index{generic length scale model!boundary conditions}

The GLS model (see section \ref{Sec:GLS}) requires that Neumann boundary
conditions are set for stability, however, the boundary conditions on the
Generic Second Quantity ($\Psi$) depend on other modelled variables. In
order for the boundary conditions to be set correctly, enable the \linebreak
\option{\ldots/subgridscale\_parameterisations/GLS/calculate\_boundaries}
option.


\section{Ocean biology}
\index{biology}

Enabling this turns on the ocean biology model. In addition you also need to add several scalar fields in the first material phase:
\begin{itemize}
\item Phytoplankton
\item Zooplankton
\item Nutrient
\item Detritus
\item Primary production
\end{itemize}

There are several items that need configuring before biology can be used.
First a relationship between sources and sinks needs encoding. This is best
done by importing fluidity.ocean\_biology into
\option{/ocean\_biology/pznd/source\_and\_sink\_algorithm} and calling the
models from there. An example is given below.

\begin{example}
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
import fluidity.ocean_biology as biology

day=1./(3600*24)

p={}
p["alpha"]=0.015*day
p["beta"]=0.75
p["gamma"]=0.5
p["g"]=1*day
p["k_N"]=0.5
p["k"]=0.5
p["mu_P"]=0.1*day
p["mu_Z"]=0.2*day
p["mu_D"]=0.05*day
p["p_P"]=0.75
p["v"]=1.5*day

biology.pznd(state, p)  
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{A Python function that imports the biology module and sets the algorithm to use.}
\end{example}

The final thing to change is to add absorption coefficients in the photsynthetic radiation field for water and plankton concentration.

\section{Sediment model}
\label{config:sediments}
\index{sediments}

\fluidity\ contains a basic sediment model in which sediment is treated as a
tracer with a settling velocity and the amount of sediment falling through
the bottom boundary is recorded. Enabling sediments creates two template
fields: one for sediment concetration in the fluid and one for the flux of
sediment over the bottom boundary. These can be found at
\option{\ldots/sediment/scalar\_field::SedimentTemplate} and
\option{\ldots/sediment/scalar\_field::SedimentFluxTemplate} respectively.
It is also possible to specify multiple sediment classes, each of which can
contain a different settling velocity and hence when coupled with the
density, represent different sediment grain sizes. At least one class must
be present.

The sediment classes can use either the Template initial concentration or set their own.

Note: to use sediment, a linear equation of state must also be enabled \option{\ldots/equation\_of\_state/fluids/linear}

\section{Ocean Simulations}

This section contains advice for running a large scale ocean simulation with a large aspect ratio. This section is split into options that must be used and options that are recommended.

\subsection{Options that must be switched on}
These options are almost always recommended for large scale ocean problems.

%The \option{\ldots/problem\_type} option must be set to large_ocean.
\subsubsection{Meshes}

The mesh that you use must be a two plus one mesh which is unstructured in the horizontal and structured in the vertical.  This can be made in gmsh and read into fludity, or a two-dimensional mesh can be made in gmsh and extruded within fluidity (see \ref{sect:extruded_meshes}).  
\begin{itemize}
\item The Velocity mesh must be discontinuous gelerkin polynomial order one, so set \\* \option{\ldots/geometry/mesh(VelocityMesh)/from\_mesh/mesh\_shape/mesh\_continuity} to discontinuous.  
\item The Pressure mesh must be of polynomial order two, so set 
\\* \option{\ldots/geometry/mesh(PressureMesh)/from\_mesh/mesh\_shape/polynomial\_degree}  to $2$.  
\item The temperature and salinity are solved on a continuous galerkin, polynomial order one mesh (no special mesh options).
\item Also under geometry, the \option{\ldots/geometry/ocean\_boundaries} option mush be switched on, with the surface id's specified.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Time stepping}
\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/timestepping/nonlinear\_iterations} option must be more than $1$, normally $2$ is a good choice.
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase/equation\_of\_state/subtract\_out\_hydrostatic\_level} must be on.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Velocity Options}
The velocity is discontinuous galerkin.  The required options are listed below.

\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/equation} must be set to Boussinesq
\item \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation} must be discotinuous galerkin
\item \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation/advection} is upwind
\item \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation/advestion/integrate\_advection\_by\_parts} is twice
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Temperature and Salinity options}
The temperature and salinity are continuous galerkin. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation} must be cotinuous galerkin
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pressure options}

This is continuous galerkin discretisation, with a mesh of polynomial order two (already specified above).

\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation} must be cotinuous galerkin
\item \option{\ldots/solver/vertical\_lumping} must be on
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reccomended or optional settings}
These settings may be recommended, but this section is not intended to be a list of instructions, please feel free to ignore it.

\subsubsection{Meshes}

The quarature degree is usually four in this case.

\subsubsection{Velocity options}

\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation/discontinuous\_galerkin/lump\_mass\_matrix} is \textbf{off}
\item \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation/viscosity\_scheme} can be Bassi Rebay or compact discontinuous galerkin, although compact discontinuous galerkin may not work in 3d at the moment
\item \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation/advection/conservative\_advection} is set to $0.0$
\item \option{\ldots/temporal\_discretisation/theta} is $0.5$ (Crank-Nicolson), or $1$ if no advection (eg spinning up)
\item \option{\ldots/temporal\_discretisation/conservative\_advection} is set to $0.0$
\item \option{\ldots/solvers} normally gmres - could use cg if no advection (eg spinning up)
\item \option{\ldots/solvers/preconditioner} eisenstat - or try mg if using compact discontinuous galerkin vorticity (which is currently untested in 3d)
\end{itemize}


You might want to create a Viscosity field under Velocity and set it to the required value. 

An Absorption field may need to be added under Velocity to allow larger time steps to be taken, otherwise your time steps will be limited by the scale of the baroclinic waves.  This term should have a vertical component equal to  ${\frac{1}{\rho_0}} {\theta} {\Delta} {t} {g} {\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}}$ and the other components are zero. $\rho_0$ is the reference density, $\theta$ is the value set under \\* \option{\ldots/Velocity/temporal\_discretisation/theta}, ${\Delta} {t} $ is the timestep, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}$ is the background density stratification.  The absorption term can be a constant if the background stratification is constant. Otherwise, set it with a python function.  Also turn on the \\* \option{\ldots/Absorption/include\_pressure\_correction} option.

\subsubsection{Free Surface Field}
This can be added if required.  You should also select a free surface boundary condition under Velocity.

\subsubsection{Pressure options}
\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation/remove\_stabilitation\_term} is switched on
\item \option{\ldots/spatial\_discretisation/integrate\_continuity\_by\_parts} is switched on
\item \option{\ldots/scheme/poisson\_pressure\_solution} is only first time step
\item \option{\ldots/scheme/use\_projection\_method} is  on
\item \option{\ldots/solver} is normally cg or gmres
\item \option{\ldots/solver/preconditioner} is normally mg
\end{itemize}

\section{Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Problems}

This section contains advice for running Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) problems, such as laboratory-scale flows e.g. the lock-exchange and the annulus or smaller-scale ocean problems e.g. a density current on an incline. This section is arranged by options for the different levels of the options tree. Both continuous-Galerkin (P1-P1) [REF SECTION] and discontinuous-Galerkin (P1DG-P2) [REF SECTION] discretisations may be used and different options choices are distinguished where necessary.

\subsection{Problem Type}

The \option{\ldots/problem\_type} option should be set to \option{fluids} or \option{ocean}.

\subsection{Geometry}

For both P1-P1 and P1DG-P2 \option{\ldots/geometry/mesh::CoordinateMesh} is required. For P1-P1 this can then be used for both the Velocity and Pressure fields so \option{\ldots/geometry/mesh::VelocityMesh} and \option{\ldots/geometry/mesh::PressureMesh} do not need to be set.

For P1DG-P2 the velocity mesh requires discontinuous galerkin for continuity and the pressure mesh must have polynomial order two. To do this set:
\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/geometry/mesh::VelocityMesh/from\_mesh/mesh::CoordinateMesh}
\item \option{\ldots//geometry/mesh::VelocityMesh/from\_mesh/mesh\_continuity} to \option{discontinuous}
\item \option{\ldots/geometry/mesh::PressureMesh/from\_mesh/mesh::CoordinateMesh}
\item \option{\ldots/geometry/mesh::PressureMesh/from\_mesh/mesh\_shape/polynomial\_degree} to 2
\end{itemize}

If \option{\ldots/scalar\_field::GeostrophicPressure} is to be included [REF BELOW] then a further mesh needs to be added. This must have polynomial degree one order greater than the mesh used for \option{\ldots/material\_phase/vector\_field/Velocity}. To demonstrate call this mesh `GeostrophicPressureMesh' and assume the mesh used for \option{\ldots/material\_phase/vector\_field/Velocity} has polynomial order 1, then:
\begin{itemize}
\item activate \option{\ldots/geometry/mesh} and set \option{name} as \option{GeostrophicPressureMesh}
\item set \option{\ldots/geometry/mesh::GeostrophicPressureMesh/from\_mesh/mesh\_shape/polynomial\_degree} to 2
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Timestepping}

2 non-linear iterations are recommended and can be specified by setting \option{\ldots/timestepping/nonlinear\_iterations} to 2.

\subsection{Material/Phase}

To demonstrate, assume the \option{material\_phase} has \option{name} attribute set to \option{Fluid}.

\subsubsection{Equation of state}

For most problems the linear equation of state is appropriate. This is selected with \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/equation\_of\_state/fluids/linear} and other values such as the thermal contraction coefficient can be set in the options that will appear below. 

\subsubsection{Pressure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Pressure/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/continuous\_galerkin} is recommended for the spatial discretisation. 
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Pressure/prognostic/reference\_node} needs to be set.
\item \option{\ldots /material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Pressure/prognostic/scheme/poisson\_pressure\_solution} is recommended to be chosen as either \option{never} or \option{only\_first\_timestep}
\end{itemize}

Note, if the normal component of the velocity is imposed on all boundaries then either \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Pressure/prognostic/reference\_node} or \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Pressure/prognostic/solver/remove\_null\_space} need to be set, see \ref{Nullspaceremove}.

\subsubsection{Velocity}

The equation used to solve for Velocity is set under \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/equation}. For GFD problems that require the Boussinesq approximation selecting \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/equation::Boussinesq} will ensure that this is used.

A Crank-Nicolson temporal discretisation with a non-linear relaxation is recommended for the temporal discretisation [REFERENCE SECTION]. This is selected by setting:
\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/temporal\_discretisation/theta} to 0.5
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/temporal\_discretisation/relaxation} to 0.5
\end{itemize}

If using P1-P1, the following are recommended for the spatial discretisation [REF SECTIONS]:
\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/continuous\_galerkin/stabilisation/no\_stabilisation}
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/continuous\_galerkin/mass\_terms/lump\_mass\_matrix}
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/conservative\_advection} set to 0 (non-conservative)
\end{itemize}

If using P1DG-P2, the following are recommended for the spatial discretisation [REF SECTIONS]:
\begin{itemize}
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/discontinuous\_galerkin/viscosity\_scheme/compact\_discontinuous\_galerkin}
\item \option{\ldots/materia\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/discontinuous\_galerkin/advection\_scheme/upwind}
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/discontinuous\_galerkin/advection\_scheme/integrate\_advection\_by\_parts/twice}
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/vector\_field::Velocity/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/conservative\_advection} set to 0 (non-conservative)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Advected scalar fields}
The recommended options for scalar fields are considered for P1-P1 and P1DG-P2 separately. To demonstrate assume the scalar field is `Temperature'. \\
{\bf P1-P1} \\ 
The mesh used should be the \option{CoordinateMesh} and the equation type \option{AdvectionDiffusion}. 

For the spatial discretisation a control-volumes discretisation with a finite-element face value discretisation and Sweby limiter are recommended [REFERENCE SECTION] which are selected with the options:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/control\_volumes/face\_value::FiniteElement}
\item \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/control\_volumes/face\_value::FiniteElement/limit\_face\_value/limiter::Sweby}
\end{itemize}
To help increase speed it is possible to store upwind elements so they do not have to be recalculated every time step (only after adapts) [REFERENCE SECTION]. To do this activate the option:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/control\_volumes/face\_value::FiniteElement/limit\_face\_value/limiter::Sweby/project\_upwind\_value\_from\_point/store\_upwind\_elements}
\end{itemize}
An Element Gradient diffusion scheme is also generally recommended, selected under \option{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/control\_volumes/diffusion\_scheme::ElementGradient}

For the temporal discretisation a Crank-Nicolson scheme is recommended, with the control volume options of 3 advection iterations and limit theta [REFERENCE SECTIONS]. These are set with the options:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/temporal\_discretisation/theta} set to 0.5
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/temporal\_discretisation/control\_volumes/number\_advection\_iterations}
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/temporal\_discretisation/control\_volumes/limit\_theta}
\end{itemize}

{\bf P1DG-P2} \\

The mesh used should be the \option{VelocityMesh} and the equation type \option{AdvectionDiffusion}. 

For the spatial discretisation a discontiuous-Galerkin discretisation is recommended with a Lax-Friedrichs advection scheme, velocity projected to continuous space, advection integrated by parts once and a compact-discontinuous-Galerkin diffusion scheme with a vertex-based slope limiter [REFERENCE SECTIONS]. These options are selected with:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/discontinuous\_galerkin/advection\_scheme/lax\_friedrichs}
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/discontinuous\_galerkin/advection\_scheme/project\_velocity\_to\_continuous/mesh::CoordinateMesh}
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/discontinuous\_galerkin/advection\_scheme/integrate\_advection\_by\_parts/once}
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/discontinuous\_galerkin/diffusion\_scheme/compact\_discontinuous\_galerkin}
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/spatial\_discretisation/discontinuous\_galerkin/slope\_limiter::Vertex\_Based}
\end{itemize}

For the temporal discretisation a Crank-Nicolson scheme with subcycling is recommended. This can be set with:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/temporal\_discretisation/theta} set to 0.5
\item{\ldots/material\_phase::Fluid/scalar\_field::Temperature/prognostic/temporal\_discretisation/discontinuous\_galerkin/maximum\_courant\_number\_per\_subcycle} set to an appropriate value.
\end{itemize}
