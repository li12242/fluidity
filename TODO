R = difficulty rating {easy, intermediate, difficult, master}
 
- Change all scripts and codes so that they know if absolute or
  relative paths are being used. This will then make flcur
  redundant. (R=easy)

- Replace eigenvalue decomposition routines in jacdia() with those
  from LAPACK. (R=intermediate)

- Set NIMEM and NRMEM according to NONODS/MXNODS in project file
  (R=intermediate).

- Update RPM support (R=intermediate)

- Replace existing IO with CGNS - requires a rewrite of
  at least COMSCA(),REDFIL() and DATFLU() (in gem). This will also fix
  check-pointing when adaptivity is used. (R=master)

- Make all arrays dynamically allocateable. (R=master)

- Write a "CREDITS" file for the project.

- Add an appropiate copyright(left) notice.
