to create the Makefile from Makefile.in (Makefile is no longer in the repository)
cd .. (to the fluidity trunk directory)
./configure

to compile the code, including the fluidity library on which this code now depends
make mp (from the fluidity trunk directory)

to run a test case:
cd tests
cd BL_test_10element_1d (for example)
make clean
make ! this compiles external functions for this test case
../../../bin/multiphase_prototype BL_test_10elements_1d.flml 

everything that goes to the screen goes to flog.dat

in input.dat: 
### Option for debugging: if =357, then all print statements will
### be sent to the file flog.dat, otherwise to /dev/null
option_debug   357

change option_debug to -1 make the all output flog.dat go to /dev/null


mirror_int_data.dat: contains all the values used. 
CheckSparsityMatrix.dat: contains the sparsity of all the matrices.
